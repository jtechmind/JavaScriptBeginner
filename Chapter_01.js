/**
 * Variable, Value and Data types in JavaScript
 */

// Variavle are container for storing information/value/data.
// Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
// var, let and const are the keywords used to declare an variable.

// Data Types: Primitive and non-primitive are two categories of data types.
// In Primitive we store only single value to it.
// In non-primitive(Object/Reference) we can store complex data.
